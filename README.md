# Metal-Gear-Solid-2-Master-Collection-PC-SAVEGAME-MODDED-All-items-and-weapons-in-beginning
8 Savegame Files - MODDED WITH ALL WEAPONS AND ITEMS - ALL MISSIONS COMPLETED IN 1 PLACE, SNAKE TALES COMPLETED, ALL DOG TAGS - ALL UNLOCKABLES IN THE GAME.
* TO ENSURE THAT THE COPY OF THE SAVE WILL WORK FLAWLESSLY, IT IS RECOMMENDED TO DO IT WHILE THE GAME IS OPEN. OTHERWISE, STEAM WILL SYNCHRONIZE WITH THE CLOUD WHEN THE GAME IS LAUNCHED, DUPLICATING THE FILES IN EACH GAME FOLDER AND RESULTING IN A SAVE READING FAILURE. COPYING THE FILES WHILE THE GAME IS OPEN WILL RESOLVE THIS ISSUE.
